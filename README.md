# Iframely API for Responsive Web Embeds

Iframely is fast and simple HTTP API for responsive web embeds and semantic meta. The API covers well [over 1600 domains](https://iframely.com/try) through 150 custom domain plugins and generic parsers for [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/), [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/cards/overview), powered by Iframely's whitelist. 

The whitelisting is manual process, and we do every-day manual regression testing to ensure integrity. [Submit your domain](https://iframely.com/qa/request), if you publish embeds.

HTTP API are available as [oEmbed](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) or [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) formats. To make it simple to understand, Iframely format mimics the `<head>` section of the page with its `meta` and `links` elements.

In response to `url` request, APIs returns you the embeds and meta for a requested web page. Below are samples from [hosted API](https://iframely.com), just to show you the format:

- [>> Hereâ€™s API call for Coub video](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.json)
- [>> Same one, but as oEmbed](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.oembed)

Iframely can also be used as Node.js library. 
Requires Node version 0.10.22 and up. 

## Get started:

The simplest way to see Iframely in action is by using our [Chrome plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/iframely-url-previews/bbafbcjnlgfbemjemgliogmfdlkocjmi). This way you will see the embeds on your (or any really) site right away (but not on GitHub due to Content-Security-Policy, sorry). 

Or, [try Iframely demo with your very own or any other Twitter feed](https://iframely.com/try). Don't forget to click on results to see the embed codes.
