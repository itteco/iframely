# Iframely API for Responsive Web Embeds

This is the self-hosted version of Iframely's APIs and parsers. 

Iframely gives your fast and simple API for responsive web embeds and semantic meta. The parsers cover well [over 1800 domains](https://iframely.com/domains) through 200+ custom domain plugins and generic support for [oEmbed](http://oembed.com/), [Open Graph](http://ogp.me/) and [Twitter Cards](https://dev.twitter.com/docs/cards), that are powered by Iframely's whitelist. 

The whitelist file is pulled from iframely.com database and is updated automatically. The whitelisting is manual process on our end. You can also [have your own whitelist](https://iframely.com/docs/whitelist-format) file. 

HTTP APIs are available in [oEmbed](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) or [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) formats. To make it simple to understand, Iframely format mimics the `<head>` section of the page with its `meta` and `links` elements.

In response to `url` request, APIs returns you the embeds and meta for a requested web page. Below are data samples from [hosted API](https://iframely.com), just to show you the format:

- [>> Hereâ€™s API call for Coub video](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.json)
- [>> Same one, but as oEmbed](http://iframe.ly/ACcM3Y.oembed)

Iframely can also be used as Node.js library (that's how it is used in our [cloud API](https://iframely.com)). 

Requires Node version 7 and up. 


## Not included as compared to Cloud API

Hosted [cloud APIs](https://iframely.com) add optional iFrame renders and number of widgets such as cards, GIF support, player events, AMP, and others. Our [more/less](https://iframely.com/docs/more-less) toggle for per-URL customizations, predictive height mechanism for non-iFrame embeds, lazy-loading, type-based whitelist and fallbacks as well as number of other customizations is only available in the cloud. 

This open-source version provides the web parsers only, though hosted API uses data from parsers as-is. The API endpoints between the version should match format pretty closely, though there might be minor discrepancies.

There's also a bunch of domain parsers that are not included in self-hosted version. Those are the parsers that we consider vulnarable for changes on publisher's origin servers and so requiring quicker turnaround time for any updates and fixes.
