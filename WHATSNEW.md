# Iframely Changelog

This is the history of the Iframely changes. Updates that are older than one year are not shown.

Stay tuned, either by watching [Iframely on GitHub](https://github.com/itteco/iframely) or following [Iframely on Twitter](https://twitter.com/iframely).


### 2015.05.07, Version 0.8.5

- Urgent fix for YouTube as they retired v2 API. 
- Set `config.providerOptions.youtube.api_key` with your Google API key to restore all previous features. See sample local config.
- API key is optional: if not given the parsers will fallback to oEmbed data. 
- It may be the same key you have for new Google Maps, yet copy it in other option.


### 2015.05.06, Version 0.8.3


- New Google Maps plugin to support current URL scheme (Google finally stopped re-directing our user-agent to their classic URLs)
- Google Maps require API key: get it [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide#api_key) and configure as `providerOptions.google.maps_key` - see sample local config
- Support of [Camo Proxy](https://github.com/atmos/camo) for all images (thanks guys from Redbooth). See sample config to activate
- Fixes for Spotify and minor fixes for other domains
- Restored domain plugin for The Guardian


### 2015.04.02, Version 0.8.2

- Fixes for some domain plugins like path.com, visual.ly, prezi, deviantart, storify, roomshare.jp
- Twitter statuses can now have variable width (through `&maxwidth` param) and are aligned to center
- New Facebook Video embeds. Yay!
- New plugins for CartoDB, wasu.cn, ku6.com, datpiff.com, tudou.com, deezer



### 2015.03.04, Version 0.8.0

*Heads up:* 

Starting from this version, the minimal Node.js version required for Iframely is 0.10.22. We had to make a choice to either support latest Node.js or earlier version due to incompatible libraries dependenices. Please, run 'npm update' to update libraries. Unfortunatelly, update likely won't work if your Node is earlier than 0.10.22.


- Instagram status JS embeds with rel `app`
- Tumblr status JS embeds with rel `app` (beware: embeds don't work with SSL)
- International domains for Pinterest
- Google custom maps
- YouTube playlists and timed embeds
- Google+ posts for international usernames. Plus, properly exclude posts in groups
- Medium stories will now have JS embeds too
- Fix issues with caching of JSONP requests
- Number of fixes in various other plugins


### 2014.12.30, Version 0.7.2

Happy 2015! Iframely domains whitelist is now free and is delivered to every server instance. Over 1600 domains at the moment!

Other changes in this version:

 - New `gifv` rel for players. Following Imgur's footsteps, it is to indicate MP4 videos that represent gifs and need to be shown as looping video. 
 - New `promo` rel, to indicate that embed is attached to the URL. For example, YouTube's used by domains in Twitter cards and Open Graph videos will now be returned with a lot more options and with rel `promo`. 
 - The same `promo` approach covers all Brightcove's players used on the domains. 
 - Gfycat is a new embeds provider (with `gifv` player)
 - HBR.org, tudou.com, forgifs.com, Google Drive - also added as new providers
 - As whitelist is available to everyone now, we removed some of domains that are covered all right by generic parsers
 - Whitelist now works for hosted oEmbed domains too. It looks at oEmbed discovery and if no domain record found, adds one by API domain. It coveres, for example, all custom domains of SmugMug, WordPress and Behance.
 - Number of domains have been cleaned up. Pinterest boards, for one. 

 Cheerio library has been updated to a newer version. Please, `npm update`.


 Happy 2015 again! And thanks for all your support in 2014!



### 2014.11.21, Version 0.7.1

This version contains mostly the cleanup of the domains plugins. Some of the most significant improvements are these:

 - Proper handling of Imgur gifs that they changed recently
 - Gallery embed for Flickr user profile pages
 - Vine plugin uses newly introduced oEmbed endpoint. Processing time is now down to 50-70ms
 - Google Plus posts with vanity URLs are finally supported
 - Google Docs support
 - Handle Tumblr's new 12-digit post IDs
 - New or improved embed codes for C-Span, Reuters, Comedy Central, Rap Genius, Giphy, Real player cloud

The package dependencies updated some libraries. Please, run `npm update` to use newer verisons.

In the other news, we published [oEmbed API](http://oembedapi.com) for the use in open-source projects. Take a look.



### 2014.10.15, Version 0.7.0

**API Params.**

This release introduces filtering parameters both in [oEmbed API](https://iframely.com/docs/oembed-api) and [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) formats. 

The optional parameters in API calls are:

- `autoplay=true` or `1` - will give preference to `autoplay` media and will try to return it as primary `html`. Check for `autoplay` in primary `rel` to verify.
 - `ssl=true` or `1` - will return only embeds that can be used under HTTPs without active SSL mixed-content warnings (images and mp4 videos trigger only passive warnings and thus will be passed)
 - `html5=true` or `1`- will return only embeds that can be viewed on mobile devices or desktops without Flash plugin installed
 - `maxwidth=` in pixels will return only embeds that do not exceed the desired width

**API Format changes** 

The [Iframely API](https://iframely.com/docs/iframely-api) response has number of improvements.

- We added a root level `html` and `rel` fields that include embed data from most appropriate link according to your filtering params. 
- For each embed link, we also added a field `html` with the generated HTML code to simplify server-server integrations (so that [iframely.js](https://iframely.com/docs/iframelyjs) isnâ€™t required). This does not include image MIME type.
-  Supplementary rel `ssl` is now included for all links that are SSL-proof. 

These changes should be backwards-compatible. Report any compatibility issues you encounter on [GitHub](https://github.com/itteco/iframely).

**Other improvements**

- As usual, number of domain maintenance, including autoplay variants for YouTube, Vimeo, SoundCloud and Wistia
- Facebook posts and Pinterest embeds can now be adjusted based on your `max-width` value
- Added some domains, such as IMDB, Break.com, Zing.vn, Stitcher podcasts, Prostopleer
- PDF documents embeds via Google Docs Viewer
- Embed codes for Flash now go with `<embed>` html. To make this accurate, Flash and text/html links are double-checked for MIME-type. This involves additional HTTP request for the URL parsers and adds a little time to processing.

### 2014.04.16, Version 0.6.2


__SOME BIG NEWS__: Iframely is now also available as [hosted cloud API](http://iframe.ly).


Generic changes this build:

* Iframely now properly proxies HTTP error codes, such as 401, 403, 404. If origin host times out, Iframely will return 408. 
* Iframely will also generate 404 on private or removed YouTube videos and on private Facebook posts.
* HTTPS is no longer strict. The HTTPS origins with SSL certificate issues will be tolerated and parsed. For example, some Linux distributions will have GoDaddy as unknown signing authority and such deployments will otherwise not be able to parse such origins.
* `application/xhtml+xml` is now allowed MIME type of the origin URLs. For example, this makes Facebookâ€™s mobile pages work.
* Fixed a bug, where some domain plugins that used `oembed-video-responsive` mixin did not actually work without a whitelist file.
* Direct links to images are now returned with rel `file` instead of `image`. `type` will still be actual MIME type of the file. 
* Changed rel `reader` to `app` for some plugins. For example, Instagram, Facebook, Google+, Twitter are now `app`

oEmbed endpoint:

* Fixes the output of original `html` in oEmbed for non `inline app`.
* Fixes the size without 'px' in oEmbed `html`, which screwed up at least SoundCloud embeds codes in oEmbed endpoint.
* Fix to pre-refactor version and do not return `autoplay` widget as oEmbed video.


Facebook:

* Ignore (403) private Facebook statuses.
* Better (HTML5) embed codes for posts.
* Remove the old `photo` plugin. Now photos are returned as posts only.
* Let FB mobile links to be parsed.

YouTube:

* White-list all hosted YouTube in Open Graph tags.
* Thumbnails with black stripes - no more. Plus `maxresdefault` thumbnail where possible.
* Return 404 when API returns no data (video removed).

New domains:

* 56.com, vk.com, mail.ru
* GettyImages. Yay!
* MIT videos
* ebaumsworld.com

Other domains:

* Fixed TED. (no more oEmbed auto discovery on the pages)
* Support of HaikuDeck's new URL scheme.
* Better titles and descriptions for number of domains.
* HTTPs URLs and API response for Imgur.
* Tweaks for Vevo regexp to allow more URLs.
* Return QZ as `safe_html` for better reader implementation.
* Codepen is now faster as they rolled out support of oEmbed.
* Tumblr: If image/video caption is actually a post, return it as such and reduce title to the first sentence of it.
* Tumblr: re-direct to original video URL if embed code isn't iframe (e.g. for Hulu embeds).
* Exclude hosted YouTube from Metacafe parser (will be handled by generic one).
* slide.es changed domain name to slides.com.
* video.pandodaily.com - no more (switched to YouTube channel).





### 2014.03.04, Version 0.6.0

And, after substantial refactoring, we have a shiny new core! 

Iframely got several times faster response time, increased traffic capacity, and smaller memory footprint. Now, the processing time for cache misses depends solely on latency of the _start_ of a server response from URL's origin host. The technical details of the refactoring follow below. In a nutshell, we've adapted the streaming approach pioneered by [Felix BÃ¶hm](https://github.com/fb55) and migrated to libs that are based on this approach. 

Please, run `npm install` to update the package dependencies. 

_Beware_: The interfaces of Iframely core lib have slightly changed and remain unstable as we continue to work on release of Iframely as Node.js lib. The HTTP API endpoints interfaces remained intact.


**Functional changes**:

 * Iframely core lib doesn't have hosted renders of its own any longer. It will produce `html` for the server API to build upon.
 * As a result, the `/oembed` endpoint now has the native `html` of e.g. Twitter, Facebook and Google+ statuses, GitHub gists, Instagram, etc. (as renders were inside the lib, it had hosted wrappers before).
 * We added new functional `rel`  - `app` - so that lib can output native embeds html for statuses, oembed type rich, etc.
 * There is now cache in Iframely's core lib any longer (except for favicons). Response caching has been moved to the API endpoint views.
 * Domain plugin maintenance included necessary fixes. Plus several redundant domain plugins were removed, and some were added, like Behance and Behance hosted sites, Droplr.
* Readability is now called strictly when `og:type` is article (if Readability is allowed in config, of course)


**Details of internal changes in the core lib**:

 * Overall streaming approach for parsers, including migration to `htmlparser2`, `cheerio` and `readabilitySAX`.
 * The plugins architecture is extended to the core params as well. Initial core parameters `meta`, `oembed`, `og`, `twitter`, `cheerio`, `readability` are now returned by system plugins rather than a hardcode.
 * The processing wave for plugins is now strictly asynchronous and supports streaming pipes. A plugin is now called as soon as all the params it depends upon are available.
 * Post processing of the embed links and meta has been moved to system plugins as well, to make it asynchronous too.
